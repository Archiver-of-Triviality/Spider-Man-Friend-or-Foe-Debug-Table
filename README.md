# Spider Man Friend or Foe Debug Table

This game contains tons of left over debug features, probably more than 100. This Cheat Engine table allows you to activate them while playing.<br>
<br>Another way to activate the debug features without the use of Cheat Engine is to add the appropriate debug entry to the Gameplay.ini in the "ini" folder within the game's directory.
<br>For example:<br>
Anim Names = true
